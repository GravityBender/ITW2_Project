      With its shimmering, jet-black coat, rounded head and brilliant golden eyes, the Bombay cat resembles a tiny panther, but the similarities stop there. The Bombay has no wild blood. The Bombay is as friendly as they come, making this cuddly lap cat the perfect blend of exotic looks and sweet personality.<br>
      The Bombay is a hybrid breed (a new breed that’s created by mixing two different breeds together). The Bombay is the result of breedings between the American Shorthair and the Burmese.<br>
      Cats are known for being independent, but Bombay cats didn’t get the memo. Bombays crave human company, and they’re known to follow you around from room to room, twining themselves around your legs as you walk. If you work long hours away from home, or travel a lot, a Bombay might not be the best breed choice.  Because they are outgoing and social, Bombays will greet strangers with curious interest and are happy to play with kids as long as they are gentle.  Bombays even get along with friendly dogs and other cats, especially when raised together.

      <h3>History of the Bombay Cat</h3>
      The Bombay as we know it in the U.S. was developed by a cat breeder by the name of Nikki Horner, who sought to create a cat breed that looked like a miniature panther. Although it took her many years, meticulous planned breedings between the Burmese and the American Shorthair cat eventually resulted in a breed that looked a lot like a Burmese, but with a jet-black coat. Horner chose the name Bombay as a nod to India’s black panther, her inspiration for creating the new breed. <br><br>
      The Bombay inherited various traits from the two founding breeds. The Bombay’s body type is very similar to that of the Burmese, with a few differences. Though compact, stocky and muscular, the Bombay is slightly longer than the Burmese. The Bombay’s laidback personality is much like that of the American Shorthair, though the Bombay is also highly social and curious, like the Burmese. <br><br>
