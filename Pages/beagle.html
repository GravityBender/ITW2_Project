        <p>The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
            The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of 
            smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog 
            for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is
             intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader
                 and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion
                  to the body. They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers 
                  and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average</p>

            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>The beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as 
                "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on 
                the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers,
                 they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark 
                 or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by 
                 Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire 
                 Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title"> <span>History</span></h1>
        <p>The origin of the beagle is not known. In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought
             the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain. In Britain both of these strains 
             were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting.
              Beagles are similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though smaller and slower.[1</p>
