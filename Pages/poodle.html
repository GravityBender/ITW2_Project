        <p>The Poodle is most commonly claimed to have been developed in Germany, although it is also 
            claimed to be from France. The Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to
             retrieve game from water. The smaller varieties of the breed were bred from the original 
             in France where they were once commonly used as circus performers, but have become popular companion dogs.</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>The Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the different breed varieties varying predominantly
                 by their size. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale's breed standard states the 
                 Standard Poodle stands between 45 and 62 centimetres .The Poodle does shed, but instead of the 
                 fur coming off the dog, it becomes tangled in the surrounding hair. 
                This can lead to matting without proper care.The Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, 
                including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, café au lait, silver beige, cream,
                 apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, phantom, and brindle. 
                 The AKC recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, 
                 only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation. </p>

            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>Poodles are known as a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. They require both 
                physical and intellectual activities. A typical Poodle should be reserved and a little aloof 
                with strangers upon first introduction, but after a while should slowly reveal a warm and personable 
                disposition once the dog realizes the new person is trustworthy and means no harm. Snappy, vicious behavior 
                is considered a serious fault in the breed. Though not suitable for being a guard dog because it is neither
                 a territorial breed nor particularly aggressive, Poodles who are well loved and cared for will reciprocate 
                 with devotion and loyalty: a dog of this breed is normally quiet and calm, but if it is totally sure danger 
                 is near, it quickly becomes very protective of its master, its master's spouse, and its master's children..</p>

        <p>Whatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate 
            the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game
             as well as to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.[3][4] The breed's
              distinctive lion coat clip developed as a practicality when they were used as waterfowler
              's dogs, with the long hair around the chest providing insulation for the dog's vitals in 
              freezing water, while the shorn hindquarters reduced drag whilst swimming and the tufts of
               hair on the legs provided purchase in the water</p>
