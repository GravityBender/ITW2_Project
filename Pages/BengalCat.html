      Bengal cats are beautiful, smart, and wild-looking cats. This hybrid cat
      breed is growing in popularity due to its patterns and personalities, and
      it stays about the same size as a large domestic house cat. They were
      developed by breeding an Asian leopard cat (Felis bengalensisâ€”which is
      where the name "Bengal" was derived) with a domestic house cat such as an
      Abyssinian, Egyptian mau, or American shorthair.

      <h3>History of the Bengal Cat</h3>
      A Bengal cat is considered a hybrid breed. Bengals are not typically included in lists that exclude exotic or big cat breeds due to the fact that they are smaller, are accepted by several other organizations as a pure breed, and are bred consistently past three generations (the first three generations look and act the wildest). Licensing requirements for Bengal cats were removed in the United Kingdom in 2007. <br><br>
      While there were previous attempts at breeding hybrids between African leopard cats (ALC) and domestic cats, the Bengal cat hybrids are credited to Jean Sudgen Mill in the 1970s. She acquired hybrids from Dr. Willard Centerwall who was breeding them at Loyola University to study their genetics. She bred the hybrids with domestic cats to produce a breed that had the personality of a domestic cat and an exotic look. Greg and Elizabeth Kent crossed African leopard cats with Egyptian maus to develop a line of Bengal cats as well.<br><br>
      Bengals are best-loved for their wild-looking markings. Rosettes, marbling, spots, and stripes make up the leopard patterns that varying Bengals display but their official markings are only considered either spotted or marbled. The patterns are always outlined in black, chocolate, or grey/silver. The coat colors are called brown tabby (most common), seal sepia tabby, seal mink tabby, seal lynx point, black silver tabby, seal silver sepia tabby, seal silver mink tabby, and seal silver lynx point. All shades of brown to black make up the markings and the brown tabbies typically have white background fur on their whisker pads, chin, chest, abdomen, and inner legs.<br><br>
