        <p>Husky is general term for a sled dog used in the polar regions. Modern racing huskies
             (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest 
             dogs (the Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, pulled heavier loads at a slower speed).
             Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies have marketed tourist 
             treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions. Huskies are also 
             kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>Siberian Huskies are a medium-sized working dogs. Their compact bodies are built for endurance,
                 so they can pull sleds for miles without running out of energy. They have beautiful fluffy, 
                 thick double coats that require regular grooming. Their ears are close-fitting and sit high on the head.
                  One of the most notable features on a Siberian Husky is their blue or brown almond-shaped eyes;
                 some dogs have one of each!</p>

            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>Siberian Huskies are friendly, intelligent and strong-willed dogs. They are pack animals 
                who need to be around people and other pups. In fact, many will “talk” to you with unique 
                howls, growls and whimpers—it’s an endearing part of their personality. 
                This friendly nature—even with strangers—means they don’t make good guard dogs.
                These energetic dogs do not enjoy long periods for contemplation—they may contemplate
                destroying things if left to their own devices for too long. And if left alone in the
                 backyard, they are known to escape, eager to explore the world beyond their borders. 
                 So, secure fencing is a must.</p>

        <p>Siberian Huskies were originally bred as working dogs in Siberia (and are still to this day!).
             The Chukchi people bred these dogs to be companion dogs and to work as sled dogs in the long,
              frigid winters of Siberia. The dogs hauled loads over miles of frozen tundra, which enabled 
              the Chukchi people to expand their hunting and gathering territories.
            They were originally brought to Alaska to pull sleds during the Gold Rush years of
             the late 1800s to early 1900s. At this time, they also participated in sled-dog races 
             alongside other sled dogs like Alaskan Malamutes and Samoyeds.</p>
