            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate
                 breed of dog. As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and 
                 biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master. The 
                 breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of 
                 children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.
                  They usually retain many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent 
                  scent of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs 
                  it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.
                  Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.</p>

        <p>The Golden Retriever was developed in Britain in the 19th century by Sir 
            Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated 
            Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other 
            British dog breeds.Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed 
            stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of
             romantic tales were published about the breed's origins.</p>
