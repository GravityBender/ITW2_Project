        <p>The Chihuahua is the smallest of all dogs breeds and has smooth and long-haired coat varieties. 
            Originating in Mexico, Chihuahuas were bred for companionship. They are best known for their big,
             erect ears and large, prominent eyes. The Chihuahua’s personality is comparable to a terrier’s—fearless
              and devoted. Chihuahuas are a generally healthy breed with an average lifespan of 12-14 years.</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>Current breed standards defined by registries specify an "apple-head" or "apple-dome" skull 
                conformation. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, 
                dramatically rounded skull. The stop is well defined, forming a near-90-degree angle where the 
                muzzle meets the skull.Dogs of the older "deer" type, with a flat-topped head, more widely set eyes,
                 larger ears, and longer, more slender legs, may still be registered.</p>

                makes her an excellent traveling companion. Chihuahua also require early socialization for acceptance. They are very curious and 
            alert dogs and are mostly busy with themselves. Thery are very confident and self relient.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title"> <span>History</span></h1>
        <p>Chihuahuas remained a rarity until the early 20th century, and the American Kennel Club did not 
            register a Chihuahua until 1904. In a 1520 letter, Hernan Cortés wrote that the Aztecs raised 
            and sold the little dogs as food. Colonial records refer to small, nearly hairless dogs at the
             beginning of the 19th century, one of which claims 16th-century conquistadores found them plentiful
              in the region later known as Chihuahua.</p>
