      What's a Dog breed?<br /><br />
      People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog
      breeders used wolves to create domestic dogs. From the beginning, humans
      purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and
      herding are thought to be among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by the
      animal destined to be called “man’s best friend.”<br /><br />
      For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental
      traits best suited for the work expected of them. The sleek Greyhound
      types bred to chase fleet-footed prey, and the huge mastiff types used as
      guard dogs and warriors, are two ancient examples of dogs bred for
      specific jobs.<br /><br />
      As humans became more sophisticated, so did their dogs. Eventually, there
      emerged specific breeds of dogs, custom-bred to suit the breeders’ local
      needs and circumstances. The Greyhound, for instance, was the foundation
      type for the immense Irish Wolfhound and the dainty Italian Greyhound. All
      three have a distinct family resemblance, but you’d never mistake one for
      another.<br /><br />
      So, then, when is a breed a breed and not just a kind or type of dog? The
      simplest way to define a breed is to say it always “breeds true.” That is,
      breeding a purebred Irish Setter to another purebred Irish Setter will
      always produce dogs instantly recognizable as Irish Setters.<br /><br />
      Each breed’s ideal physical traits, movement, and temperament are set down
      in a written document called a “breed standard.” For example, the breed
      standard sets forth the traits that make a Cocker Spaniel a Cocker Spaniel
      and not a Springer Spaniel.
