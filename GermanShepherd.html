        <p>The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of
          medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. According to the FCI, the breed's English language
          name is German Shepherd Dog. The breed name was officially known as the "Alsatian Wolf Dog" in the UK from 
          after the First World War until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd. Despite its wolf-like
          appearance, the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with its origin dating to 1899.</p>

            <h1>Intelligence</h1>
            <p>German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence. In a list of breeds 
                most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.
                 Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police,
                  guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks
                   and interpret instructions better than other breeds</p>

            <h1>Temperament</h1>
            <p>German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[30] 
                The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious,
                 which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective
                  of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to
                   become immediate friends with strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient,
                    as well as protective of their owners.</p>

        <p>During the 1850s, attempts were being made to standardize dog breeds.
        Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding 
        sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.Horand became the center-point of the
         breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed
          desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.
         Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.
         Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz 
          von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly 
          through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed 
          ecessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. Beowulf's progeny 
          also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German shepherds draw a genetic link.
           It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, 
           uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog</p>
